# Open divergences

Active gaps only. Resolved work is recorded in git history and
`docs/DEVLOG.md`; it does not belong in this file.

Last verified on `d7f2998`, which includes the reviewed capture, preview, and
exact-hand-gate commits (`44a7de3`, `27ec2fc`, `d198a96`).

Pixel-perfect means every owned, A/B-stable pixel is equal. Mean-error budgets,
hard-pixel floors, empty target captures, and unstable Oracle pairs are not
passes.

## Interactive C raster renderer

### First-person hand use poses

All three states have exact Java A/B captures but remain strict C residuals.
Ownership is the union of the Java and C subjects at threshold zero.

- Bow pull: `hard_px=30260`, `maxch=125`.
- Eat mid-use: `hard_px=101880`, `maxch=215`.
- Blocking shield: the old idle-tip golden was replaced by a genuine sticky
  `MAIN_HAND/BLOCK` capture; C still has `hard_px=28506`, `maxch=100`.

The former hand mean budget is gone. Synthetic exact controls pass, while
missing Java silhouette, C-extra, +1-channel, shift, and recolor mutations all
fail.

Likely work: finish ItemRenderer/model registration, edge shading, and the
remaining bow/eat sticky full-use capture provenance.

bash c/magma/raster/verify/ui_hud/run_ui_hud_gates.sh
```

### Inventory player preview

GUI chrome is bit-exact, but the rendered player remains open at max channel 1:

- Pose 1: mean `0.011641`, `442` nonzero pixels.
- Pose 2: mean `0.009949`, `323` nonzero pixels.

The current path matches RenderHelper/Mesa unorm8 light-material packing for the
dominant face bins. Smaller fixed-function primary-light bins remain.

Repro:

```bash
bash c/magma/raster/verify/mc_capture/run_gui_verify.sh
```

### Portal and underwater

- Portal is `CAPTURE_BLOCKED`: the accepted pair has max-channel-1 A/B
  instability. Atomic same-client-turn `frame_pair`, sticky portal time, and
  pinned texture animation did not make a new pair exact, so no worse golden
  was promoted. C-vs-J composition also retains a large outdoor-underlay
  residual.
- Underwater is `CAPTURE_BLOCKED`: A/B reaches max channel 3 and C-vs-J remains
  about `4.97/ch`. Eye-at-surface fog is also visibly too weak.

Neither surface may pass until the Oracle pair is exact and the C full-frame
residual is zero.

### Entity and particle pixels

No strict entity family is pixel-perfect yet:

- 11 states are `CAPTURE_BLOCKED` by nonzero Java A/B on complete family ROIs:
  slime/magma sizes and squish, dig stone/grass, and dragon fireball.
- Five stable states are honest `RESIDUAL`: dragon death at ticks 50/100/190,
  small fireball, and XP orb.
- XP now has a genuine visible, full-frame A/B-exact Oracle capture; C remains
  `hard_px=12000`.
- Small fireball no longer draws on-fire layers unless `isBurning`, but its
  complete ROI remains open.
- Dragon death uses the correct 48-bit `java.util.Random`; remaining gaps are
  body pose/UV/dissolve, fine ray orientation, and surrounding scene pixels.
- Death dissolve is still per-box rather than vanilla per-texel.

### Blaze on-fire flag in the LIVE simulator (tape replay is fixed)

Fixed for replay (2026-07-29, `wt/blazeglow`): the blaze now renders
full-bright and engulfed in fire whenever the recorded entity flags say
`isBurning()`. Vanilla mechanism, both in `java/oracle-src`:

- `EntityBlaze.getBrightnessForRender` (`EntityBlaze.java:99-102`) returns
  `15728880 = (240<<16)|240`, i.e. lightmap sky 15 / block 15 regardless of the
  world cell. `RenderBlaze` itself is a plain `RenderLiving` with no glow
  layer, so ALL of the oracle's "highlighted" look is this override.
- `EntityBlaze.isBurning()` (`:172-175`) is overridden to `isCharged()`
  (`:180-186`), the `ON_FIRE` datamanager byte bit 0 that
  `AIFireballAttack.updateTask` sets at `attackStep == 1` and clears at step 5
  / `resetTask` (`:246`, `:281-291`) - 78 ticks on, 100 off. That is what
  `Render.doRenderShadowAndFire` (`Render.java:344-348`) tests before drawing
  `renderEntityOnFire`'s layers, so an aggroed blaze burns and an idle one does
  not.

**Old tapes already carry this.** The recorder writes
`(isBurning?1:0)|(isSneaking?2)|(isInvisible?4)|(isChild?8)` per living entity
row (`QuantizedRL.java` "flags bitfield"), `replay_tape.py` forwards it as
`ent_view.flags`, and `script.c` stores it in `GmEntityView.flags`. Measured on
the three 2026-07-22 blaze tapes: 388-603 burning blaze rows each, with exactly
the vanilla 78-on/100-off duty cycle (`blaze_melee` transitions t=18, 93, 191,
269, ...). No recorder change was needed and none was made. Nothing was
inferred from "the blaze looks aggroed" - the reverted `60f4076` failure mode.

Still open: the LIVE simulator never sets the bit. `gm_mobs_fill_views`
(`game/mob_live.c`) leaves `flags` zero, and `mob_live.c` has no port of
`AIFireballAttack`'s `attackStep`/`attackTime` state machine (its blaze uses a
flat 40-tick ranged cooldown, `attack_cooldown_ticks`). So an interactive /
RL-env blaze is full-bright but never engulfed, and daylight-burning mobs
(`m->fire_ticks`) draw no flames either. Porting the attack-step machine is a
simulation change with fight-state consequences and was deliberately left out
of the render fix.

### Full-frame soft surfaces

These have useful capture-integrity checks but no pixel-perfect product claim:

- Death-screen world/tint composition outside the exact chrome and paired tint
  model remains about `33.17/ch`.
- Fire overlay full-frame composition remains open.
- Rain/overcast rendering is not modeled for the canonical rain window.
- High-altitude and long-distance haze are weaker than Java.

### Canonical tape residual unexplained clusters

The dominant early-tape failure (all CUTOUT geometry discarded: tallgrass,
cross plants, grass_side_overlay) was a misaligned positional `CrShadeCtx`
initializer and is **fixed** - see DEVLOG 2026-07-25. What remains on
`20260721T215812Z_fast_s0_survival_default_rd8_77b5b462`:

- Pixel gate still FAIL, but 7 failed frames (was 58), worst t=260 with
  7291 unexplained px (was t=80 / 74783). UNEXPLAINED total 122_581 px over
  63 frames (was 1_540_406 over 67).
- t=260 and t=460 hold the two big residual clusters (3380 px and 2989 px at
  t=260, on the near canopy and a distant tree). Re-measured 2026-07-25 with
  `pxdiff.py`: t=260 is 103 clusters, the canopy one at y[83,178] x[526,611]
  is 2989 px, `texel-selection`, exact-match 0.55 / tol4 0.83 at shift (1,-1).
  It is NOT a cutout-coverage bug, and the oracle's own capture settings say
  why it cannot be: the tape ran `fancyGraphics=false, mipmapLevels=0`, where
  vanilla `BlockLeaves.getBlockLayer` returns SOLID, not CUTOUT_MIPPED, and
  magma already meshes leaves as `CR_LAYER_SOLID` with alpha forced opaque.
  Direct count of the canopy bbox: 118 of 3991 differing pixels (3.0%) are
  true sky-holes, the other 96% are both-leaf texel flips. An earlier pxdiff
  build called this `cutout-sky+` from the mean-delta direction alone; the
  discriminator now requires a measured hole fraction, because on a minified
  canopy sigma is 50-70 and a mean of +4 along the sky axis gives an
  alignment of 0.997 at 3% coverage error.
  The leaf INTERIOR, separately, is nearest-neighbour texel selection on
  minified faces, not shading or geometry: the per-channel delta there is
  zero-mean with a large spread (near canopy mean +0.1/+0.2/+0.2, sigma 19/28/8; distant tree
  -0.9/-1.1/-0.4, sigma 32/46/14), i.e. individual texels flip between
  neighbouring values rather than the surface being uniformly off. Ruled out:
  a global sub-pixel camera offset (best whole-frame alignment is dx=dy=0,
  6.23 mean/ch, vs 7.45 at dx=-1) and the fog distance mode - the oracle's own
  GL query records `fog_distance_mode_nv = 34139` (GL_EYE_RADIAL_NV), which is
  what `CrFragment.eye_dist` already implements, and forcing planar |z| fog
  makes the tape worse (particles 181k -> 436k px, viewmodel 256k -> 411k,
  failed frames 7 -> 10).
- t=3180/3200/3220 clusters soak from `viewmodel` (hand/item residual), a
  separate open item under "First-person hand use poses".
- Residual whole-frame mean at t=80 is 3.76/ch, all outdoor terrain: grass
  tint / AO / luminance (the `known:4` class), not geometry.

### Double-height plants render as solid tinted slabs

Found 2026-07-29 recording `scenario_scenic_walk_20260729T063050Z` (seed 3
default world, dense forest): the oracle draws the forest-floor grass as
normal cross-plants, magma fills the same cells with opaque
biome-green quads that occlude trunks behind them. The seed-0 canonical
area spawns single tallgrass (id 31, handled by the CUTOUT fix) but not
the double_plant family (id 175, two-block grass/fern/peony), which the
mesher appears to emit as untextured tinted geometry. Repro: replay the
scenic_walk tape, t=80, center of frame. Not gated anywhere yet - no
committed tape covers double plants; the tape is kept in tapes/ for the
fix. Launch-thread note: the zoom video's wipe segment was moved off this
scene onto hold_dig_dense because of this bug.

### Nether arrival: fire/lava content missing from the replayed world

Found 2026-07-29 on the first dense portal tape
(`scenario_portal_roundtrip_20260729T075228Z`); **root-caused and fixed the
same day**. Neither suspect in the original note was right: no filter dropped
fire (51) or lava, and the patch never covered DIM-1 because **there was no
DIM-1 to cover**.

- The recorder snapshots the save at `recstart` (`QuantizedRL.java`, recstart
  handler). A dimension the player first enters DURING the recording has no
  region files on disk at that moment, so it can never be in that copy:
  `075228Z_world/DIM-1/` held only `data/` and `forcedchunks.dat`, and
  `snapshot_patch.py` emitted 0 dim -1 events (its cache is 29 events, all
  dim 0). The replayed Nether was therefore 100% magma's own generation.
- magma generates Nether TERRAIN (`nether_full.h` `nf_run` =
  ChunkProviderHell prepareHeights/buildSurfaces/MapGenCavesHell + fortress),
  which is why the cave geometry matched. It does not run
  `ChunkProviderHell.populate` - fire, lava springs, glowstone, quartz, magma
  blocks, mushrooms - and it cannot: that method's `Random` is reseeded only
  in `provideChunk` (`ChunkProviderHell.java:267`), so `populate` consumes
  whatever RNG state the previously generated chunk left behind. Nether
  decoration is chunk-load-order dependent, not seed-derivable. The saved
  world snapshot is the only sound mechanism for it.
- Second, independent defect on the replay side: `snapshot_arrival_events`
  detected arrivals only from position packets, and a portal transit has none
  (the server moves the player inside `changeDimension`). On this tape the
  row `dim` flips at t=133 and the first `ppos` is t=168, so even with DIM-1
  data the patch would only have been applied at tick 0, to a world the
  player was not in yet.

Fixes: `snapshotSaveDir(mc, snapRoot, addOnly)` in `QuantizedRL.java` - the
recstart pass is unchanged, and `recstop` runs a second ADD-ONLY pass that
copies only paths the snapshot does not already have, so dimensions born
during the recording are added while recstart truth for the start dimension,
`level.dat` and `playerdata` is never overwritten with end-of-session state.
Plus the dim-flip arrival in `replay_tape.py::snapshot_arrival_events`.

The 075228Z tape is NOT repairable - its Nether was never written to any
disk that still exists - so the scenario was re-recorded with the fixed
recorder as `scenario_portal_roundtrip_20260729T083543Z` (dims {0:134,
-1:352}, `recstop` reported `snapshot_added: 4`, one per Nether region file).
Same-tape A/B, CPU replay (DIM-1 region hidden vs present, patch cache
dropped both times): 387 failed frames / 75.1M UNEXPLAINED px over 368
frames, worst t=292 at 266k -> 170 failed frames / 11.2M px over 143 frames,
worst t=281 at 175k. Fire and the arrival lava pool are present and the
chamber is lit in both panes (t=216, t=280 SBS).

Still open on that tape (170 frames): fire/lava ANIMATION phase and the
lightmap around them, plus the pre-existing viewmodel/HUD classes.

Newly found, separately scoped: `nf_to_vanilla` in
`c/mc-sim/core/nether_full.h` maps `CPN_LAVA`(10) -> vanilla 10 and
`CPN_FLOWING_LAVA`(11) -> vanilla 11, but vanilla 1.11.2 is 10 =
`flowing_lava`, 11 = `lava` (still) (`Block.java:2414-2415`), and
ChunkProviderHell fills the sea with `Blocks.LAVA` (still). magma's generated
Nether sea is therefore FLOWING lava: 123,556 of the new tape's patch cells
are id-11 lava at y 24-31. The nether_full golden is a self-capture of the C
kernel, not a Java oracle, so nothing caught it. Not fixed here (it needs a
regenerated golden and an mc-sim gate pass); the snapshot patch masks it in
replay.

### Eye-in-fluid overlay timing: CLOSED (root-caused 2026-07-29)

Found 2026-07-29 on the dense elytra tape
(`scenario_elytra_dense_20260729T082313Z`, frames every tick) via a
per-tick L/R mean-abs scan - the 10-tick gate summary never showed it:
- t=142..151: magma draws the full-screen lava submersion overlay/fog
  (~75/255 mean abs) while the oracle eye is still ABOVE the lava
  surface during the skim. Ten ticks of solid red on magma only.
- t=78: magma still applies underwater fog one tick after the oracle
  eye exits the water curtain (single-tick flicker, ~70/255).

Both filed suspects were wrong. Two independent causes, neither in the
`liquid_height_percent` boundary and neither a tick-phase problem:

**1. The lava band is PHYSICS, not overlay timing.** The tape's first
divergence is tick 141 `vy`: oracle `0.30000001192092896`, magma
`-0.10051` (`= -0.16102 * 0.5 - 0.02`, i.e. magma ran the lava branch
correctly but skipped the climb-out kick). `EntityLivingBase`
`moveEntityWithHeading`:2119 sets `motionY = 0.3` when
`isCollidedHorizontally && isOffsetPositionInLiquid(...)`;
`Entity.isOffsetPositionInLiquid`:651 is TRUE when the offset box is
FREE, and its collision half is `World.getCollisionBoxes`, which keeps a
candidate only if `Block.addCollisionBoxToList`:548 passes
`AxisAlignedBB.intersectsWith` (strict `<`, `AxisAlignedBB.java:341`).
`psv_offset_in_liquid` was calling `psv_collect_blocks` - a broadphase
CELL scan, inclusive on `floor(max)` and reaching one cell below
`floor(minY)` - with no intersects re-filter. The elytra pilot is pressed
against a wall at `x = 37`, so his box maxX is exactly `37.0`; the
broadphase returned the wall cell, the kick never fired, and instead of
popping out of the pool he sank and stayed eye-deep in lava for ten
ticks. Fixed by re-filtering with `mc_aabb_intersects`, exactly as
`psv_update_elytra_size` already documents having to do. Removing that
one line of slack also removes every downstream residual on the tape
(t>=152 went 4.4-5.0/ch to 0.7-1.2/ch) and the physics gate is clean.

**2. The viewpoint is not the eye.** `ActiveRenderInfo.projectViewFromEntity`
adds the static `position` vector, which `updateRenderInfo`:50 gets by
gluUnProject-ing the viewport centre at winZ 0 - the NEAR PLANE - through
the finished modelview. First person that modelview carries
`orientCamera`'s `translate(0,0,0.05)` (EntityRenderer:681) and the
projection is `gluPerspective(..., zNear = 0.05F, ...)` (EntityRenderer:730),
so the camera sits 0.05 ahead of the eye and the sampled point another
0.05 ahead of the camera:
`viewpoint = (x, y + eyeHeight, z) + 0.1 * getVectorForRotation(pitch, yaw)`.
At t=78 the eye is at x 11.98790 - still cell 11, water - but the oracle
viewpoint is 11.98790 + 0.09903 = cell 12, air. The remaining `position`
terms (view bobbing, hurt camera) are zero on these tapes:
`EntityPlayer.onLivingUpdate` zeroes `cameraYaw`'s target whenever
`!onGround`, and no tape frame is inside `hurtTime` at a fluid boundary.
They are NOT modelled; a ground-level tape that crosses a fluid surface
while walking would need them.
Consequence worth remembering: `ItemRenderer.renderOverlays` is gated on
`isInsideOfMaterial(WATER)` alone, off the entity's own eye with no
look-ahead, so the overlay texture and the fog/FOV can legitimately
disagree for a tick at a surface crossing. `gm_uw_eval` no longer nests
the overlay test inside `fluid == 1`.

Result on the dense tape: t=78 70.35 -> 0.80/ch, t=142..151 ~75 -> 0.7-1.3/ch,
no physics divergence at all, unexplained gate frames 178 -> 10 (the
survivors are the pre-existing t=58..65 waterfall-entry cluster and t=77,
unchanged by this work).

### Waterfall ENTRY window on the dense elytra tape (t=58..65)

Pre-existing 8-frame failure on scenario_elytra_dense_20260729T082313Z
(worst 19.85/ch at t=58), unchanged by the eye-in-fluid fixes - the exit
(t=78) and the lava band (t=142..151) are closed, the entry is not. The
glide crosses INTO the waterfall over these ticks; suspects are the same
eye/viewpoint family at water entry or curtain-cell content during the
crossing. Dense tape is the repro; not yet root-caused.

### Fortress-hunt tape finds (2026-07-29, scenario_portal_fortress_blaze)

Three divergences from the staged fortress-melee recording
(`tapes/retired/scenario_portal_fortress_blaze_20260729T090129Z`):
- **Fortress placement**: `gm_fortress_locate`/`gm_fortress_spawner_room`
  and mc-sim `nether_full` both put seed-0's spawner room at
  (-325, 72, -151); the oracle's own DIM-1 region files have rooms at
  (-325, 56, -215) and (-325, 56, -102). x matches, y/z do not - the
  structure-gen port diverges beyond terrain.
- **Blaze death animation**: on kill the oracle renders the death body
  (scaled, hurt-tinted, ~53k px at t=278); magma keeps the live-size
  model until despawn. `pxdiff` calls it cutout-sky+ (content absent).
- **Spawner cage miniature**: the oracle draws the spinning miniature
  blaze inside the mob-spawner cage; magma draws the cage only.
Harness notes that cost takes (now in the yaml): `structures: false`
disables fortresses entirely; melee attacks fire on the mouse-DOWN edge
so held button-1 lands exactly one swing (this is why the older
blaze_melee/blaze_bow tapes never damage their blaze); the target is
NoAI-pinned because a live blaze kites to fireball range.

### Scenario tape pixel-gate failures (triaged, unfixed)

Diagnosis only, from a delegated triage pass; the code claims below were
spot-checked but the pixel measurements are the triage agent's, not
independently re-measured here.

- `scenario_soulsand_ice_20260723T001810Z`: **closed** (2026-07-25). The 44
  mild-shift failures were the sky-plane fog: `orientCamera` puts the 64-tile
  sky plane at `16 - eyeHeight` and vanilla's fixed-function fog on it is
  per-vertex Gouraud, not per-pixel (`ac47c2b`). That left one frame, t=60, a
  77%-of-frame 5.37 shift on the step down onto soul sand: the `fogColor1`
  light smoother was sampling the post-tick feet, one tick ahead of vanilla's
  pre-movement `updateRenderer` (`5c4cf6e`). The tape is rc=0.
  Still open on this tape: ~1226 px of UNEXPLAINED at t=50, in 7 clusters of
  50-370 px (plus viewmodel-masked siblings), all mid-frame on the receding
  soul sand path with the grass either side clean. `pxdiff.py` on the
  texel-selection bands (e.g. y[320,331] x[407,444]): zero_shift 26.26/ch,
  best_shift dy=-1 at 1.52/ch; remeasured as C[y]≈G[y+1] at 0.4-1.5/ch
  across those rows. At yaw=-90 pitch=0 the screen-Y axis maps to texture U
  (world X / path depth), not V.
  **Sampling-rule dead end (2026-07-25, wt/texel):** magma already uses
  GL_NEAREST `floor(u*w)` (default is `floor(u*w - 1e-4)`; pure floor via
  MAGMA_SAMPLE_MODE=1 is bit-identical on this residual). Vanilla 1.11.2 with
  `mipmapLevels:0` binds the terrain atlas as plain GL_NEAREST (EntityRenderer
  only forces non-mip for CUTOUT; SOLID uses the upload filter, still nearest
  with no mips). Sweeps: round / UV+0.5 drop UNEXPLAINED to 165 but raise
  whole-frame mean 3.51→5.47 and shred HUD/viewmodel; U+0.2 yields unex 864
  mean 3.43 (partial, no principle); every V bias worsens both metrics. No
  sampling-operator change gets unex→0 without a nightly regression - do not
  fudge MAGMA_TEXEL_BIAS. Residual is UV phase at pixel centres (wrong side of
  texel boundaries on the oblique top faces), not floor-vs-round. Checked
  separately: `raster_cpu.c` already samples at `(px+0.5f, py+0.5f)`, so the
  other cheap phase suspect - rasterising at the pixel corner - is ruled out
  too. What is left to test is the quad's world position / perspective-correct
  UV precision on grazing top faces, which is a different investigation.
- `20260712T055346Z_fast_s0_survival_default_rd8_77b5b462`: the goldens have
  no HUD, and magma used to draw one. **`capture.hide_gui` is a misnomer** and
  the original diagnosis in this entry was wrong about the mechanism: the tape's
  own `qrl_launch` records `hide_gui: false` with `strip.overlays: true`, so the
  recorder skipped the overlay pass rather than Malmo forcing
  `gameSettings.hideGUI`. The goldens draw a first-person viewmodel on nearly
  every frame - a bare arm on most of them, a held item on a few - which
  settles it. That matters because vanilla's real `hideGUI` would take
  the hand and the portal wash with it; "overlays stripped" takes only the
  overlay, so the portal wash stays tied to this flag (it is drawn inside
  `renderGameOverlay`) while suppressing magma's HAND is a workaround for the
  arm's over-bright shading, not fidelity. `options.bobView` is also false in
  this recording, so the oracle's viewmodel never bobs - it sits on identical
  screen pixels frame to frame, which is what made the yaw-sweep test decisive.
  The original (wrong) framing follows, kept because the pixel numbers in it
  are real: the goldens have no HUD and no first-person hand (Malmo forces
  `hideGUI` for the mission),
  magma used to draw both, and the gate's positional `hud` and `viewmodel`
  accepts swallowed the whole mismatch - the bottom 96 rows plus the lower
  right quadrant had no pixel verification at all on this tape.
  `capture.hide_gui` + `MAGMA_HIDE_GUI` stops magma drawing them (`3dc2d19`,
  `81ea54e`), and the gate stops accepting those regions positionally when the
  tape sets that flag: `_positional_accept_masks(hide_gui=True)` returns empty
  HUD and viewmodel barriers. The legacy sidecar regions, all recorder gaps and
  all scene-global, were widened from y1=383 to y1=479 for the same reason:
  their old limit was an artifact of the mask, not of the gap.
  `hideGUI` covers more than the overlay. `EntityRenderer.renderHand` gates
  `renderItemInFirstPerson` on `(thirdPersonView == 0 && !sleeping &&
  !hideGUI && !spectator)` (oracle-src `EntityRenderer.java:824`), and
  `GuiIngame.renderPortal` is called from inside `renderGameOverlay`
  (`GuiIngame.java:156`). `itemRenderer.renderOverlays` (block-in-hand, water,
  fire) and `hurtCameraEffect` sit outside that branch at line 833 and stay on.
  Failed frames go 14 -> 25 -> 19. That is the price of measuring a quarter of
  the frame that was never measured before, on all 157 frames; the tape was
  already failing. The rain window t=1800..2100 now resolves cleanly into
  `known:12` where before it leaked, the four pure-arm frames
  (t=360/440/480/500) are gone, and what is left in the newly measured region
  is t=520 (near-field pit floor, same dirt palette in a different projection -
  the golden's floor texels streak, magma's stay square, everything outside the
  pit matches to 0.1 percent) and t=2440 / t=2860.
  t=2440 IS the hand, and an earlier revision of this entry said it was not.
  The transient brown object in the bottom-right corner is the oracle's held
  wooden shovel. `capture.hand_from_tick` (2440 here, carried to
  `frame_capture.c` as `MAGMA_HAND_FROM_TICK`) turns magma's hand back on from
  that tick: t=2440 goes 3.167 -> 0.969 per channel whole-frame and stops
  failing (`c4b7f00`), and at t=2860 both sides now draw the same shovel.
  **What that tick actually means** is not what `c4b7f00` claimed. It is not
  the tick where the oracle's viewmodel returns - the oracle draws a viewmodel
  through the whole tape. It is the first golden at which MAGMA's held item is
  finally known to be right. The tape rows carry no `inv` field at all; the
  only inventory magma ever receives is two `set_inventory` rows in
  `<tape>.worldpatch.jsonl`, at t=2274 (item 58, crafting table) and t=2320
  (item 269, wooden shovel, slot 6). Before t=2320 magma holds nothing and can
  only draw a bare arm, which is wrong wherever the oracle holds something; the
  first golden after the re-anchor is t=2440. So the hand window is a property
  of the sidecar, not of the oracle, and it moves if the sidecar is extended.
  **t=1140..1220 is a BARE ARM, not a held block, and this entry said otherwise
  twice.** The yaw-sweep test was right that the corner object is a screen-fixed
  viewmodel; the identification of it as a held block was wrong. Opening the
  lower-right crop of the goldens at t=0, 900, 1140, 1800, 2400, 2800 and 3100
  shows the same skin-toned tapered wedge in the same screen position over
  seven completely different backgrounds (water, grass, stone, planks). That is
  `ItemRenderer.renderArmFirstPerson` with an empty main hand, and magma has
  had that path since the HAND agent landed it.
  **A discriminator that reads backwards, so do not reuse it:** the fraction of
  that box holding wood/skin colour is constant to three decimals (0.747 /
  0.748 / 0.747 / 0.747 / 0.747) over t=1140..1220 and swings wildly (0.089 /
  0.000 / 0.000 / 0.436 / 0.005) over the confirmed hand window t=2440..2520.
  The constancy is real and the reading taken from it was not: it says
  "screen-fixed", which a bare arm and a held block satisfy equally. Compare
  the two frames at 2x and look, rather than scoring a colour fraction.
  **A gate hole this exposed:** `hide_gui`/`hide_hand` drop the POSITIONAL
  viewmodel barrier, but `pixel_gate` also has a post-hoc semantic `viewmodel`
  class ("held-item region: lower-right, touching a frame edge") with a 40000 px
  budget, and the same `hud` heuristic (`y0 >= h*HUD_FRAC`) shadowed the bottom
  rows, so un-masking those regions did not actually put them under measurement
  on any frame where a heuristic fired - the 17969 px at t=1180 were classed
  `viewmodel` and never counted. Both semantic classes now honour
  `hide_gui`/`hide_hand`. On this tape `hud` disappears entirely (107 frames /
  244695 px of it were never an explanation), `viewmodel` drops to the ticks
  from 2440 where there really is a hand (63 frames / 461603 px -> 35 / 94657),
  and failed frames go **18 -> 28**. That is the price of measuring the last
  unmeasured quarter of the frame, and every one of the new failures is in it.
  No other tape sets `capture.hide_gui`, so nothing else moves.
  With the gate honest, the viewmodel is the single largest remaining
  divergence on this tape: **11 of the 20 cluster-failing frames** are
  dominated by one cluster in that corner, in two silhouettes - 30064-30503 px
  at y[349,479] x[559,853] over t=600..660, and 17076-18406 px at y[335,479]
  x[601,771] over t=700 and t=1200..1340.
  **It is NOT recorder-blocked, and an earlier revision of this entry filed it
  that way.** The oracle is empty-handed for most of the tape, so there is no
  inventory to miss; magma's arm geometry is already right. What is wrong is
  the arm's SHADING. Forcing the hand on for the whole tape
  (`MAGMA_HAND_FROM_TICK=0`, which now overrides the sidecar) and comparing the
  gate-independent per-tick `whole mean/ch` against the suppressed run: **110
  of 157 frames get worse, 10 better, 37 unchanged** (mean 5.91 -> 6.92). The
  arm is drawn far too bright. On the two cleanest frames, where terrain and
  sky agree to within 1/255:

  | tick | probe | golden | magma | ratio |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | 900  | arm (639,429)     | (139,103,84) | (192,173,148) | 0.72 / 0.60 / 0.58 |
  | 900  | terrain (639,299) | (87,114,69)  | (87,114,70)   | exact |
  | 900  | sky (299,59)      | (155,188,255)| (154,190,255) | exact |
  | 1140 | arm (639,429)     | (146,107,88) | (201,180,154) | 0.73 / 0.60 / 0.58 |
  | 1140 | terrain (640,301) | (152,147,103)| (152,147,104) | exact |

  **Half of that was a SKIN MISMATCH, and reading the ratio as "per-channel, so
  a lightmap colour" was wrong.** The tape header has no `skin` field, so
  `replay_tape.py` fell back to slim and magma drew ALEX against the oracle's
  Steve. The tape's own `qrl_launch.determinism.pin_skin` is true, and
  `MixinRandomSkinTexture` forces the classic model whenever it is set;
  `tape_skin()` now honours it (`db5ac63`). Against the Steve texel (150,111,91)
  the golden is a clean scalar 0.660/0.658/0.659 - it was never a coloured
  multiplier, it was a paler texture. With Steve drawn, forcing the hand on for
  the whole tape flips the A/B: **91 of 157 frames better, 29 worse, 37
  unchanged, mean whole/ch 5.91 -> 5.07** (t=900 7.44 -> 6.17, t=1140 4.69 ->
  1.38, t=2300 2.50 -> 1.15). The suppression is still on because the residual
  is unfixed, not because the arm is a net loss; flipping the sidecar is a
  release-time call since it re-baselines the tape.
  **There is no "scalar ~1.57x over-bright arm" residual. That entry was wrong
  and is retracted (2026-07-25).** It came from dividing the golden by a raw
  atlas texel, which prices in the shading the oracle also applies. Measured
  against the actual magma render on the actual arm pixels, the arm is already
  right. Method: replay the tape twice, once with `MAGMA_HAND_FROM_TICK=0` and
  once with it past the end, and take the arm mask as the pixels where the two
  differ by more than 3 (eroded 2x to drop the silhouette); then read
  golden/magma over that mask. Every rain-free frame from t=0 to t=1780 comes
  back **0.997 / 0.995 / 0.995**, on 16796 arm pixels, across seven distinct
  yaw/pitch poses (yaw 0 to -390, pitch -45 to +90). `hand_diffuse` and
  `build_arm_matrix` need no further work; do not go looking at the eye-space
  normals, which is what the retracted entry sent the last agent to do.
  What is actually left on the arm is two things, neither a hand bug:
  - **The rain window t=1800..1980**, where the arm ratio is a flat achromatic
    **0.670 / 0.668 / 0.672** while sky (0.787/0.805/0.827) and terrain
    (0.758/0.774/0.694) are chromatic and milder. The arm is the pure lightmap
    readout - it takes no fog blend - so it shows the whole error. See "The
    lightmap ignores rain and thunder" below; the arm is just the cleanest
    place to measure it.
  - t=2020..2200 (0.836/0.904/0.920) and the wild ratios at t=2280/2360/2680/
    2760, which are frames where magma holds a different item, or none - the
    `worldpatch.jsonl` inventory re-anchor gap already filed above.
  Because the arm is exact outside those two windows, **flipping the sidecar's
  `hand_from_tick` to 0 is now the better default** and no longer trades a
  known-wrong brightness for a position win. It still re-baselines the tape, so
  it stays a release-time call.
  **Pickup inference cannot rescue the held-item intervals, so do not try it.**
  The idea was to derive `set_inventory` rows from `EntityItem`s that vanish
  near the player. The tape does carry 8673 EntityItem rows, 530 of them within
  three blocks of the player, but every one is **7 fields**
  (`id, name, x, y, z, yaw, pitch`) with no item id. The worldpatch is no help
  either - all 1317 of its `set_block` rows are at tick 1, an initial-world
  snapshot rather than an edit log. Recovering WHICH item needs the tape
  re-recorded with the every-20-tick inventory keyframes the recorder now
  emits; recovering the ARM does not.
  **t=540..660 is a held DIRT BLOCK, and it is inferable from the tape.** These
  are the only 10 ticks the forced-hand A/B improves, because magma's pale arm
  is closer to a brown block than the grass it draws with no hand at all. The
  player is looking straight down (`pitch` exactly 90.0 across the window) and
  the corner is filled by a dirt-textured object that is pixel-identical at
  t=600 / 620 / 660 while the grass at its edges shifts. A whole-corner region
  test says "terrain" here and is wrong - region `[350:480, 560:854]` tracks the
  background (mean |d| 0.85 / 10.98 / 11.93 against a control of 0.96 / 15.22 /
  14.13) only because the viewmodel is a small part of it. The 12x14 patch at
  the arm's own location is identical to 0.1 across all four ticks. Take the
  measurement on the object, not on a region that mostly is not the object, and
  then look at it at 3x.
  The inputs say the same thing: `atk` at t=560, `use` at t=680, i.e. mine,
  hold, place. That is the one held-item interval on this tape whose identity is
  recoverable without re-recording - not from `EntityItem` (no item id) but from
  the block that was mined, by ray-casting the recorded eye/yaw/pitch at t=480
  (the mine runs t=480..562 at `pitch` 15, the place t=611..680 at `pitch` 90
  with `y` climbing 71 -> 73, i.e. pillaring up with what was just dug). Doing
  it needs magma's generated world, not just the sidecar: the worldpatch is a
  sparse PATCH of 1317 cells, not a full snapshot, and a raycast against it
  alone hits nothing. Nobody has tried it. The
  goldens over that window also draw the block selection outline, which is
  worth checking against magma separately.
  **A wrong reading to not repeat:** the t=1800..1960 window first looked like
  a missing first-person held item - the oracle shows a dark held log and
  magma appeared to show none. It is not. Golden/candidate over that window is
  a uniform ~0.45 ratio across the whole frame including the sky (t=1900 whole
  0.726, sky 0.809, ground 0.696), i.e. the already-filed oracle rain
  darkening; magma's log is simply drawn at full brightness against grass and
  reads as absent at a glance. Zoom before concluding.
  The other canonical tape, `20260721T215812Z`, has a HUD on all 181 goldens
  and is unaffected; do not set `capture.hide_gui` on it. Its own 7 failed
  frames are all ONE family and it is the texel-selection residual above, not
  anything tape-specific: t=260 (7291 px) and t=460 (6252 px) fail on
  `texel-selection` clusters at sel 0.55 / 0.50 on a distant canopy and a
  grazing leaf underside, where both sides draw the same leaves from the same
  palette in a shuffled arrangement plus a 1-2 px sky/leaf silhouette edge.
  t=300 / t=320 / t=700 have no UNEXPLAINED cluster over 300 px at all and fail
  purely on mild-shift, i.e. the same wash spread thin. Closing the texel
  residual closes this tape.
- `scenario_slime_bounce_20260723T001527Z`: the slime platform renders too
  dark. Baseline on current master: **15 failed frames, 6709 UNEXPLAINED px**.
  `models/block/slime.json` (1.11.2 jar) has TWO elements - inset core
  `[3,3,3]..[13,13,13]` and full cube - both without cullface.
  `BlockSlime.getBlockLayer` is TRANSLUCENT. Emitting the real inset core
  (`5da6b29`) took 19 -> 16 failed frames.
  **Per-pixel arithmetic (t=50, face ROI y[300,360], a=188/255 from slime.png):**
  solve `g = C·(1-(1-a)^2) + B·(1-a)^2`, `c = C·a + B·(1-a)` on dark residual
  pixels gives C≈tex mean [120.7,200.0,101.1] and B≈0. Golden matches dual-layer
  over black; magma matches single-layer. On dual-covered pixels (block
  centers) magma already equals golden, so `raster_cpu` SRC_ALPHA
  (`c·a + d·(1-a)`, blend=1, no depth write) is correct when both layers hit.
  **Coverage map:** residual is a block-scale checkerboard - bright dual centers
  (core XY [3,13]^2) vs dark single rims (the 3/16 XZ frame where only the
  outer top draws). Golden is uniform dual brightness across the whole face.
  Rim fraction of a top face is `1-(10/16)^2 ≈ 61%`, which matches the bulk of
  the dark residual.
  **Levers tried (2026-07-25, wt/slime2), all rejected or insufficient:**
  - Full generalQuads (no neighbor cull on both elements): 15 -> 17 failed,
    darker (confirms prior -93/ch overshoot). Vanilla draws those quads
    (`BlockModelRenderer.java:105-110`) with GL cull + `sortVertexData`, but
    magma still overshoots when given the same layer count.
  - Translucent B2F sort alone (painter's order on 6-vert quads): 15 -> 14
    failed on this tape, but nightly REGRESSION on `elytra_dip` UNEXPLAINED
    784 -> 16495. Not landed.
  - Always-emit all 6 core faces (outer still culled): no further gain; core
    sides do not fill the rim to dual-top brightness (side shade 0.8 stacks to
    ~0.78·C, dual top is ~0.93·C).
  - Coplanar outer re-emit: 12 failed / 4.03 (prior), fakes uniform dual
    coverage; not the model; not landed.
  **Source and ordering closure (2026-07-27, wt/slimerim):**
  the adjacent-slime cull hypothesis is ruled out. `ModelBakery.java:685-698`
  puts every face whose JSON `cullface` is null into `generalQuads`; therefore
  slime's two six-face elements produce 12 general quads and zero per-facing
  quads. `BlockModelRenderer.java:93-110` calls `shouldSideBeRendered` only for
  per-facing lists and renders the null-facing list unconditionally.
  `BlockBreakable.java:37-55` does suppress a face against the same block type,
  but that method is never consulted for these 12 quads. Shared faces must
  therefore be present in the vanilla buffer.

  The other two state hypotheses are also source-closed. Vanilla sorts
  TRANSLUCENT quads by descending squared centroid distance within each
  16-high `RenderChunk` (`RenderChunk.java:339-344`,
  `VertexBuffer.java:69-92`) and renders the layer with depth writes disabled
  (`EntityRenderer.java:1448-1466`). Magma already uses the same SRC_ALPHA
  blend without a translucent depth write (`cpu/raster_cpu.c:209-219`), so a
  first translucent face cannot selectively occlude the inset core through
  the depth buffer.

  A new combination experiment tested the two faithful source consequences
  together rather than repeating either rejected lever alone: emit all 12
  general quads for every slime and partition the C column mesh into vanilla
  16-high sections, sorting each section's six-vertex quads by the same
  descending centroid-distance key. It regressed **15 -> 17 failed frames**;
  UNEXPLAINED stayed **6709 px**, and t=50 whole/terrain error increased from
  **7.21/8.00 to 7.93/8.83 per channel**. Reversing both section and quad order
  was a direction diagnostic, not a proposed fix: it failed much harder at
  **19 frames, 73321 UNEXPLAINED px**, with t=50 whole/terrain
  **34.80/35.74**. Neither change is landed.

  The t=50 arithmetic explains why ordering looked plausible but also refutes
  it as the missing implementation lever. On 30205 selected dark-rim pixels,
  golden/candidate medians are `[113,185,95]` / `[91,148,76]`; on 2061
  already-dual pixels both medians are `[114,185,96]`. With
  `a=188/255`, a dual top has coefficient
  `1-(1-a)^2 = 0.930965`. A top plus two 0.8-shaded internal N/S faces behind
  has coefficient `a + (1-a)*0.8*(1-(1-a)^2) = 0.932940`, only
  `[0.24,0.40,0.20]` RGB above dual at the texture mean. That numerical match
  does not survive the actual source-defined quad population and order.

  **Gate-accounting correction:** in the current baseline, `pxdiff clusters`
  assigns the large dark platform clusters at t=50 to the semantic
  `particles`, `viewmodel`, and `hud` masks. The reported 6709 UNEXPLAINED
  pixels are the separate horizon-edge family, so a rim-only correction cannot
  make that counter approach its alleged ~750 floor without changing
  classification. The next non-fudged experiment needs a live oracle
  translucent draw capture (quad buffer plus post-transform fragment order),
  not another inferred cull/sort/depth variant.
  Open gap: how vanilla keeps the rim as bright as dual-top without the
  overshoot magma hits when fed full generalQuads. Blend equation itself is
  not the bug on dual-covered pixels.
- `scenario_elytra_dip`: **re-recorded 2026-07-27 as `20260727T214459Z`**
  (old `20260723T001355Z` moved to `tapes/retired/`, baseline swapped). The
  new tape has settled liquids (200 settle ticks per setup command), a
  converged recorded `fog_color1` (0.99999976 in the header), and the lava
  sea trimmed to x<=36 - the first settled recording (`213715Z`, also in
  retired/) landed at x=40.7 in the last lava column, burned to death
  standing there, and respawned at world spawn, which replay cannot follow.
  Current state: **1 failed frame, t=60, 3010 px** - narrow ~12px vertical
  strips inside the curtain where the golden renders darker falling-water
  streaks and magma is flat brighter blue (cluster means g [45,65,160] vs
  m [48,69,182]). Texture animations ARE pinned on this tape, so it is not
  animation phase; it is the flow-texture selection/orientation on falling
  cells viewed from inside the curtain, the same family as the rejected
  native `water_flow` quadrant experiment. Whole-frame at t=60 is
  mean_abs 3.57 (threshold 3.32), ratio g/m ~0.98/ch.
  The remainder of this entry documents the RETIRED `20260723T001355Z`
  tape's failures for the record; its mechanisms (fogColor1 warmup at t=0,
  mid-growth waterfall at t=60-80) are closed by construction on the new
  tape.
  Old `scenario_elytra_dip_20260723T001355Z`: 4 failed frames.
  **RETRACTED (2026-07-27): the t=70/t=80 "neighbour brightness for water"
  mechanism above was wrong.** Registry finalization (`Block.java`
  `registerBlocks` tail) sets `useNeighborBrightness` only for stairs, slabs,
  farmland/grass path, translucent, or `lightOpacity == 0` blocks. Water has
  opacity 3 and `MaterialLiquid.blocksLight()` keeps it non-translucent, so
  vanilla samples the water cell's OWN light - exactly what magma already
  did. Forcing the neighbour lookup for water fails `water_dive` 93 frames.
  Lava DOES qualify (registered without `setLightOpacity`, so opacity 0 -
  magma's 255 was the real light bug, fixed with the exact
  `getLightBrightness` port through rk_14 in `game/underwater.c`; all four
  water tapes now diff clean against the oracle's saved SkyLight, see
  `trace/skylight_diff.py`). t=70/t=80's decay improved by neither, which
  fits the mid-growth waterfall below: the oracle's feet crossed water cells
  whose growth state magma's frozen approximation does not carry.
  The other failures are t=0 (4.39/ch plus
  an 85 px one-row registration cluster) and t=60 (10.62/ch water-colour wash,
  463 unexplained px). A separate native `water_flow` quadrant experiment
  removed that cluster locally but caused broad `water_dive`/`water_flow`
  regressions and was also rejected.
  Re-confirmed from the frames (2026-07-26): only t=60 is underwater (a
  one-frame dip); golden's underwater frame is brighter with per-channel
  ratios R 1.084 / G 1.072 / B 1.135, and after resurfacing golden carries a
  decaying brightness excess (1.026 at t=70, 1.016 at t=80, 1.004 at t=90,
  gone by t=110) - a `fogColor1` that dropped less during the dip than
  magma's. With the neighbour-brightness reading retracted, the remaining
  driver is the water cells themselves: the oracle's dip crossed a
  partially-grown curtain whose cell contents (and thus feet light) differ
  from magma's frozen approximation.
  **The t=60 463px cluster is a DEVELOPING waterfall the replay cannot
  represent (2026-07-26).** The scenario fills a single water wall at x=10
  (`/fill 10 4 -3 10 22 3 water`) and starts recording immediately; the x=9
  and x=11 curtain columns are that wall's live sideways spread, still
  growing through the first ~seconds of the tape. The world save is
  post-capture (fully grown, all three columns, oracle skylight 12/9/12 at
  z=0), so `tape_to_script`'s elytra post-capture-spread heuristic freezes an
  approximation: x9+x10 falls patched in at t0, x11's dropped, everything
  cleared at t=65 before player contact. Both directions of "fix" were
  measured and are wrong: keeping x11's falls (sustained-under-source
  exemption in `post_capture_spread`) takes t=60 from 463 to 14047
  UNEXPLAINED px because the golden still sees past the curtain's right edge
  at t=60; the committed drop leaves the 463px top-of-screen sliver where the
  golden's partially-grown x11 fall has water and magma has none. Magma's
  fluid CA does not grow it either: snapshot water is deliberately not
  fluid-marked (re-simulating patched water was the rejected native
  water_flow experiment). The clean fix is in the scenario, not the replay:
  add a settle wait between the water fill and recstart and re-record -
  already on the re-record decision list.
- `scenario_ender_dragon_20260722T093713Z` (stale, superseded by `094040Z`):
  magma draws large extra bright geometry the oracle does not have (45216 px
  cluster at t=420, magma mean `[118,124,89]` where the oracle is
  `[34,45,30]`), so this is added content rather than a gate misclass. One
  contributing cause is confirmed in code: `gm_runtime_set_dimension`
  (`game/runtime.c:1022`) never calls `gm_dragon_init`, which only the portal
  path (`game/runtime.c:609`) does, so an authoritative tape dimension switch
  arrives in the End without the fight initialised. Prefer `094040Z` as the
  dragon gate tape.
  Do **not** "fix" this by calling `gm_dragon_init` from `set_dimension`:
  `replay_tape.py` already turns every recorded entity into a render-only
  `ent_view` ghost, and `frame_capture.c:712` fills live-dragon views before
  appending ghost views, so a live dragon would be drawn *on top of* the tape
  one. The symptom here is too much bright geometry, not too little, so the
  likelier cause is End island worldgen / snapshot coverage at x~100. The
  portal path additionally carves a platform and sets the pose, neither of
  which an authoritative tape transfer should do.


### CPU/CUDA replay parity: closed, keep sweeping

Parity had only ever been measured on one tape. The canonical
`20260721T215812Z` replay is bit identical CPU vs CUDA, but a full 23-tape
CUDA sweep on GPU0 (`sm_120`, `nightly_20260725T062525Z`) was **FAIL** with
baseline regressions on six tapes where the CPU sweep was PASS.

The terrain half of that is **fixed**: `cuda/raster_cuda.cu` built its MVP with
`cr_look_yaw_pitch_dev`, which is look-only, while the host path uses
`cr_camera_view` - so CUDA silently dropped
`EntityRenderer.hurtCameraEffect` (hurt roll/yaw). Every tick the player took
damage, the CPU rendered a rolled horizon and CUDA a flat one. Both MVP sites
now call `cr_camera_view_dev`.

On `scenario_blaze_bow_demo_20260722T104234Z` (407 frames, serial runs):
whole-tape diff 12_212_050 px before, 9_344_718 after the hurt fix, and the two
hurt bursts collapse (fi=43: 167_824 px -> 36; fi=231: 156_540 -> 23). With
`MAGMA_NO_DEFER=1` on top, 12_875 px total, 0 frames over 1000, max 46 - sky
stars only. The remainder is the deferred-frame-end issue above.

Ruled out along the way: GPU contention (serial re-runs reproduce
byte-for-byte); a chunk/mesh upload budget (`wl_ensure_mesh` is dirty-driven,
there is no per-frame budget); and the early player deaths, which happen
identically on the CPU and are a separate matter.

Re-run of the 23-tape CUDA sweep on GPU0 after the fix
(`nightly_20260725T071901Z`): 15 rc=0 / 8 rc=3, the same tally as the CPU
sweep, with baseline regressions on **two** tapes instead of five.
`scenario_ender_dragon_20260722T094040Z`,
`scenario_ender_dragon_demo_20260722T104500Z` and
`scenario_lava_walk_20260722T234940Z` are now byte-identical to their CPU
baselines on every class.

The two that still regressed were both the deferred frame end, and both are
now **fixed** - the DEFERRED path reproduces the CPU baseline byte-for-byte on
every class, `failed_frames` and the state block:

- `finish_pending` re-derived the fire overlay's fov scale as
  `cam.fov_deg / 70`, which folds in `getFovModifier`'s bow-pull / sprint
  term; the sync path passes `uw.fov_scale`. Divergence on exactly the
  fire+bow ticks (`blaze_bow_demo`: 57 failed frames -> 1).
- `finish_pending` also re-ran `gm_overlay_block_in_hand_live` against
  `c->pend_world`, which is just the live world pointer, so the eye-block
  sample happened one rendered frame (20 ticks) after the frame it drew. On
  the canonical tape t=660 that resolved to dirt and painted the whole frame
  with the suffocation overlay. The overlay is now split into pick/draw and
  the deferred path resolves at arm time.

The bisect that found the second one: `MAGMA_NO_HAND=1`, `MAGMA_NO_OVERLAY=1`,
a full `cudaStreamSynchronize` inside `frame_end_async`, and resetting the
shade-ctx ring at `frame_begin` each left the frame bit-identically wrong
(83_341_540 px, 3/3 runs), while the raw deferred readback with all host
retire draws skipped was normal (mean 81.4). That ruled out GPU asynchrony
entirely and pointed at the host draws in `finish_pending`.

A deferred-path CUDA replay is parity evidence again. Baselines remain
CPU-authoritative.

### Late-tape item acquisition on the canonical tape

Widening the inventory gate to every `inv`-bearing tick (rather than only the
every-20 sample grid) exposed two real divergences on
`20260721T215812Z`, which the old gate could not see:

- t=3257 slot 1: tape has item 270 (wooden pickaxe), magma has nothing.
- t=3267 slot 2: tape has item 50 (torch, count 8), magma has nothing.

Both are **crafted** items, and crafting/container clicks are not recorded in
tapes at all. The documented re-anchor for that is a `<tape>.worldpatch.jsonl`
sidecar carrying `set_inventory` events; `20260712T055346Z` has one, the
canonical `20260721T215812Z` does not. So this is an instance of the known
recorder blocker ("Legacy GUI interactions and inventory contents were not
fully recorded"), not a magma simulation bug - but it was invisible until the
gate started checking off-grid inv ticks. Fix is to author the sidecar from the
oracle session save, or to re-record with GUI interactions taped.

The tape's exit code is still 3 (its long-standing pixel FAIL short-circuits
before the state check), so the run now prints an explicit
`[gate] NOTE: inventory state ALSO failed` and `gate_baseline_diff.py`
compares the state block.

### The world diverges from the oracle's on the canonical tape

`20260712T055346Z` reports `world nearby_hash` deltas on **96 of its 157**
sampled ticks. The hashes agree through t=300 and separate from t=400 onward,
which is where the mission starts digging. Block state is not compared by the
replay gate (only physics, inventory and pixels), so this has been sitting
under the pixel numbers rather than being reported as itself.

It accounts for the tape's worst remaining frames, t=2840..2900: 47846-48202
px, `mean_delta [-41.69, -39.60, -38.63]`, an achromatic ~40-level darkening
over a third of the frame. Side by side at 2x it is block content, not shading:
both sides are in the same mined tunnel and draw the same held shovel, but
magma has a large flat near face filling the left of the view where the golden
sees a lit tunnel receding. One side has a block the other does not. The player
holds `atk=1` continuously through that stretch. The gate classes both frames
as `particles` and only flags them because they blow the 40000 px class budget;
an achromatic darkening over a third of the frame is not particles, so the
class is wrong even though the failure is real.

The cause is the recorder, not magma's simulation: dig progress depends on the
held tool and on GUI/inventory interactions that tapes do not record (see the
recorder blocker and the `worldpatch.jsonl` re-anchor above), so magma's dig
timing drifts from the oracle's and the two worlds part company. Chasing these
frames as rendering bugs is wasted effort until either the world is re-anchored
or the tape is re-recorded with block edits taped.

### Inventory gate coverage is still uneven

The gate now reports `ticks_independent` and flags `seeded_only`, but 13 of 23
tapes still carry only the tick-0 `inv` row and so verify nothing beyond the
seed. The recorder emits an inventory keyframe every 20 ticks as of this
change; the tapes have to be **re-recorded** before that takes effect. Count
and metadata are also still not compared - only item identity per slot - so
arrow-count drift and durability ticking remain ungated.

### Truncated tapes verify only a prefix

**Seven** tapes stop at a terminal death and only ever replay part of their
length. Four of them exit rc=0, so nightly counted them fully green while
verifying less than half:

| tape | replayed | of | % |
|---|---|---|---|
| `smoke_zombie` | 358 | 803 | 45 |
| `ender_dragon_demo` | 596 | 1614 | 37 |
| `ender_dragon_094040` | 607 | 1610 | 38 |
| `wither_skeleton` | 610 | 1202 | 51 |
| `enderman_fight` | 666 | 1402 | 48 |
| `blaze_bow_demo` | 814 | 1407 | 58 |
| `blaze_melee` | 999 | 1203 | 83 |

The deaths are **correct** - the oracle dies
at those ticks too and respawns (canonical check: tape tick 813 `hp=0.0`, tick
814 `hp=20.0`) - and `continue_after_death` is deliberately emitted only for
fluid episodes (`replay_tape.py`, `game/script.c` script loop), with a test
pinning that contract.

The problem was that nothing recorded the truncation, so a tape verifying 38%
of itself reported clean. The state gate now carries a `coverage` block and the
replay prints `[tape] COVERAGE: only N of M tape ticks were replayed`. Whether
to extend the contract past respawn (emit `continue_after_death` for any
`tape_has_respawn`, teach `first_divergence` to resume, update the pinning
tests) is an open product decision, not a bug.

### slime_bounce horizon band: NOT a render-distance cull mismatch

All 15 of `slime_bounce`'s failed frames are the same static artifact: a band at
the horizon (y 244..253) spanning the full width, identical from t=60 on.
Per-column silhouette at t=80 (first row from y=235 with blue < 200): **711 of
854 columns agree exactly, 143 have magma's edge exactly one row lower**, in 4
runs of 33/37/33/35 cols (plus 1-2px stragglers).

**Hypothesis tested and refuted (wt/chunkcull, 2026-07-26):** magma's
render-distance cull does **not** use a different metric or off-by-one vs
vanilla.

| Side | Cull test | Metric |
|------|-----------|--------|
| magma | `game/world_live.c:381-388` (`gm_world_mesh_view`; twin at 459-466) | Chebyshev square `cx,cz ∈ [ccx-R, ccx+R]` with R=8, then `cr_aabb_in_frustum` |
| vanilla | `RenderGlobal.getRenderChunkOffset` (oracle-src ~1027) + `ViewFrustum` `(2*RD+1)^2` | `abs(playerChunkOrigin - neighborOrigin) > RD*16` → reject (keeps `\|d\| ≤ RD`); same inclusive Chebyshev |

No Euclidean chunk test in either path. Magma's `<= R` matches vanilla's `>`
(equality kept). Frustum port is the verified ClippingHelper path
(`core/frustum.h`); full-column AABBs for outer-ring ground sections at this
pose are **kept** for the front diagonal chunks `(±8,8)`.

**Diagonals check (tape yaw=0, vFOV 70 → hFOV ~102.5°):** run mid-angles are
**-45.8°, -34.4°, +34.3°, +45.8°**. Only two of four sit on the square diagonals;
a pure cheby-vs-euclid mismatch would be two large side sectors (~400 cols
each), not four ~35-col runs. So the angular pattern does **not** diagnose a
distance-metric bug.

**Vanilla ViewFrustum centering note (not the fix direction):** at player
(0.5,0.5), `updateChunkPositions` uses `floor(x)-8` and covers chunk origins
**-9..7**, then the BFS distance filter keeps **-8..7**. Magma's symmetric
**-8..8** is one chunk *longer* on the + side, so matching that quirk would not
raise magma's horizon.

**Cause remains open** (elsewhere than the RD cull): on the 143 run columns the
sky rows above the band are bit-identical, but the first non-sky row is a
fog/edge blend where gold crosses blue<200 one row earlier; terrain rows below
the band also still differ. `sky.h` `GM_TERRAIN_ZFAR = RD*16*sqrt2` already
matches `EntityRenderer.setupCameraTransform`. Do not widen R or fudge fog end
to paper over this.

### slime_bounce horizon band: fog-blend decomposition (wt/horizonfog, 2026-07-27)

Measured on t=80 of `scenario_slime_bounce_20260723T001527Z` (flat world, pose
feet `(0.5,4,0.5)` yaw/pitch 0, RD8, fog linear 96→128, GL_EYE_RADIAL_NV).
Replay via `replay_tape.py --cpu`; goldens from the tape frames dir. Silhouette
= first row from y=235 with blue < 200. Baseline gate: 15 failed frames,
UNEXPLAINED 6709.

**Blend model.** Horizon sky / fog colour F = (179, 207, 255) (matches
`updateFogColor` clear at this noon flat take). Unfogged terrain T recovered
from a `MAGMA_FOG=0` replay of the same tape (same geometry, no fog lerp). Then
for each edge pixel:

```
c = (1 - t) * T + t * F    →    t = fog factor in [0,1]
```

G−M colour delta at the first gold-visible row is **parallel to (F−T) with
cos ≈ −0.999** (orth residual ~2/ch): same albedo T, almost pure fog-factor
difference. Not a texel flip, not a sky-gradient bug (rows above the band are
bit-identical).

**Per-run numbers (t=80, mean over run columns at first gold-visible row):**

| run cols | mid-angle | gold sil y | magma sil y | t_gold | t_magma | Δt (m−g) | r_eff gold | r_eff magma |
|----------|-----------|------------|-------------|--------|---------|----------|------------|-------------|
| 58–90 (33) | −45.8° | 246 | 247 | 0.647 | 0.831 | **+0.185** | ~117 m | ~123 m |
| 174–210 (37) | −34.4° | 245 | 246 | 0.626 | 0.825 | **+0.199** | ~116 m | ~122 m |
| 644–676 (33) | +34.3° | 245 | 246 | 0.626 | 0.820 | **+0.194** | ~116 m | ~122 m |
| 762–796 (35) | +45.8° | 246 | 247 | 0.639 | 0.831 | **+0.192** | ~116 m | ~123 m |

Full-width mean Δt at `min(sil_g, sil_m)` is **+0.178** (std 0.057) — the
same ~0.18 over-fog is present on the 711 agreeing columns; the 143 flips are
only where gold's t pushes blue under 200 one row earlier than magma.

Re-fogging magma's nofog T with `t_magma − 0.18` cuts edge-row error from
~25/ch to ~4/ch on every run (residual then matches gold_as_fog(T) ~2/ch). So
the band **is** the fog-factor gap, not a separate coverage hole.

**Geometric coverage (`MAGMA_FOG=0`).** Magma has terrain (blue≪200) from y=244
on the run columns; with fog on, y=244–245 are sky-exact (t=1, fully fogged to
F). Gold's visible sil is y=245/246. Magma is not missing far geometry — it
draws it, fully fogged, then shows a more-fogged transition row.

**Analytic flat-plane check** (ground y=4, eye y=5.62, vFOV 70, pitch 0):

- Magma's measured t matches radial fog on the plane hit: mean
  `|t_magma − t_radial(r_hit)| ≈ 0.002` for |angle| > 10°.
- Gold is systematically under-fogged vs the same hit:
  `|t_gold − t_radial| ≈ 0.19`. Planar |z| is worse for gold
  (`|t_gold − t_planar| ≈ 0.30`).
- Magma vs documented ramp 96/128: RMSE **0.0015**. Gold vs 96/128: RMSE
  **0.15**. Best unconstrained fit for gold is roughly start≈102 end≈134
  (not a constant present in oracle-src).

**Hypothesis results:**

1. **Per-vertex vs per-pixel fog — REFUTED as the 0.18 gap.** Magma already
   does perspective-correct per-fragment radial fog (`raster_cpu.c` interpolates
   `eye_dist_w`, `shade.c` applies the linear ramp). Vanilla 1.11.2 sets no
   `glHint(GL_FOG_HINT, …)` (default DONT_CARE). On 1×1 block faces (both
   mesher and vanilla FaceBakery), max |t_true − t_affine_vertex| and
   |t_true − t_persp_lerp_r| are **~7e−5** at the horizon — three orders below
   0.18. The sky-plane Gouraud fix (`ac47c2b`, 64×64 tiles) does not transfer:
   terrain quads are 1 m, not 64 m.

2. **Planar |z| vs radial — REFUTED as the fix direction.** Oracle capture
   queries `fog_distance_mode_nv = 34139` (GL_EYE_RADIAL_NV); magma matches that
   and the analytic plane. Forcing planar was already shown to regress the
   canonical tape (OPEN_DIVERGENCES "Canonical tape residual"). Gold is closer
   to radial than planar but still Δt≈−0.18 vs true radial.

3. **Projected far-edge / half-pixel — open but not sufficient alone.** Far
   ground tops foreshorten to ~0.04 px of height; the visible rim is extremely
   pitch-sensitive (Δr ≈ 6 m for ~0.04° ≈ 0.3 px). A pure integer row-shift of
   magma vs gold is a *worse* match than same-row fog adjust (best dy=0). The
   data prefer "same pixel, same T, different t" over "magma is one row late."
   A sub-pixel registration gap could still contribute at the threshold, but it
   does not explain the global Δt≈0.18 on agreeing columns.

**What magma implements (oracle-aligned):**
`EntityRenderer.setupFog(0)` linear start=`far*0.75` end=`far` with
`far=RD*16=128` (`EntityRenderer.java:2025–2036`), plus
`glFogi(34138, 34139)` when NV_fog_distance is present (`:2039–2041`). Magma:
`GM_TERRAIN_FOG_START/END` in `sky.h`, radial `eye_dist` in `transform.c` /
`shade.c`. No `glHint` for fog in oracle-src.

**Not a safe code fix yet.** Dropping magma fog by ~0.18 (or widening fog end /
narrowing start toward the empirical 102/134 fit) would paper over gold and
break the documented vanilla ramp that magma already matches to 0.0015 RMSE on
this geometry. Next leads if revisited: (a) capture-side fog evaluation on the
recording GL stack (does the golden's driver honour EYE_RADIAL the same way the
seed7 probe claims?), (b) any remaining view/projection registration at the
0.3 px level that would put gold on a nearer isosurface while sharing T, (c)
confirm with a depth/eye_dist dump from the live Java capture at these columns.

Do **not** widen RD cull, fudge `GM_TERRAIN_FOG_*`, or retune CLASS_PIXEL_BUDGETS
for this band.

**Addendum (2026-07-27, independent re-measure): the fit degeneracy is
resolved - same fog color, real fog-factor gap - and lead (b) is the live
one.** On t=80 agreeing columns, both sides converge to the identical
sky/fog color (179,207,255) in the row above the silhouette and to the same
grass color a few rows below; magma's last terrain rows are consistently
~+37 blue foggier (x=100: gold (128,154,152) vs magma (149,176,191); x=220
and x=530 alike, and magma's sil+1 row is still fog-tinted where gold's is
already clean grass). So it is genuinely Δt with shared F, not a fog-color
difference. Converting: Δt 0.18 x 32-block ramp ≈ 5.8 blocks of effective
distance, and at the horizon's ~6 m per pixel row that is ~0.3 px of
vertical registration - exactly the sensitivity the H3 note computed, and
invisible to the integer-shift test that "refuted" it. A single sub-pixel
vertical projection offset (eye height, pitch, gluPerspective cotangent, or
viewport pixel-center convention) explains a global horizon-only Δt with
zero near-field effect. Discriminating probe: measure the sub-pixel screen
position of a tall NEAR vertical edge (slime block silhouette) golden vs
magma on the same frame - a registration offset shows there too; a pure fog
difference does not.

Probe results (same day): the near-edge measurement over 122 high-contrast
edge pairs at t=80 gives magma-minus-gold dy median 0.000 px (mean 0.21,
std 0.41 - outlier-driven), and a lower-frame band agrees (median 0.000).
A uniform screen shift, eye-height offset, or FOV-scale error would all
have moved those near edges by the same ~0.3 px, so every screen-space form
of H3 is now refuted alongside H1/H2. Separately, the oracle's LIVE GL fog
state is on record: `mc_capture/camera_seed7.json` captures
`fog_start 96.0, fog_end 128.0, fog_mode 9729 (LINEAR),
fog_distance_mode_nv 34139` from the running client, so the empirical
"102/134" fit is NOT the oracle's fog config either. What survives: either
the capture GL stack's fog EVALUATION deviates from t=(d-96)/32 at large d,
or golden's row-to-distance mapping at grazing incidence differs in a way
near edges cannot see. Next probe that separates them: compute golden's
empirical t(d) across the whole 96..128 band on the mc_capture pose/seed7
scenes (exact camera + fog state recorded per capture) against analytic
ground distances - a fog-curve deviation shows as t(d) bending off the
ramp everywhere; a mapping difference shows t(d) on-ramp but with d
shifted only on grazing ground, not on vertical faces at the same
distance.

**Addendum (2026-07-27, wt/fogcurve): t(d) probe — hypothesis A survives,
B refuted.** Repro:
`cd c/magma/raster/verify/trace && uv run --no-project --with numpy,scipy,pillow
python fogcurve_probe.py --scene all --out /home/infatoshi/dev/nw/.tmp/fogcurve`
(uses existing slime_bounce fog/nofog magma frames under `.tmp/hfog_{out,nofog}`
if present; seed7 re-rendered via `game_candidate --seed 7 --fov 77` with
`--depth` dump).

Method: recover `t = median_ch (P − T)/(F − T)` with `T` from `MAGMA_FOG=0`
and recorded `F`. Analytic eye-radial `d` on slime flat ground via ray/plane
at y=4; seed7 `d` from magma depth buffer. Magma's own `t_magma` tracks
`t_ramp = clamp((d−96)/32)` to RMSE 0.002 on clean grass (control).

Bulk mean `t_gold − t_ramp` = **−0.169** (flat across the band, not a
growing bend). Implied constant distance shift
`δ = d − (96 + 32·t_gold)`: median **5.26 blocks** (mean 5.33, std 1.52);
`0.18 × 32 = 5.76` matches the horizon-band Δt. Free linear-ramp fit for
gold: start≈**101**, end≈**134.5** (RMSE 0.045 vs 0.173 on vanilla 96/128).
Magma vs vanilla ramp RMSE **0.0023**. Flat world has no far vertical faces
in the fog band (entities empty at t=80), so orientation needs seed7.

| grass (ground)   | 975 | +0.174 | +0.002 | +0.172 |

`grass − trunk` residual = **−0.038** (B predicted **−0.18** if only
grazing ground were distance-shifted; A predicted ~0). Absolute seed7
t_gold is *positive* (gold looks more fogged) because magma nofog `T` is not
bit-aligned to the golden's albedo (lighting/smooth residuals on the
mc_capture path); that biases both classes equally and is why the
**relative** residual is the discriminator, not the absolute sign.

**Verdict: A (orientation-independent fog-curve gap).** Gold is under-fogged
by ~0.17 vs the documented linear EYE_RADIAL ramp on clean same-geometry
ground; vertical faces do **not** sit on the ramp while ground is offset, so
B (grazing-only distance mapping) is out. Equivalent descriptions of A: a
constant Δt ≈ −0.17, a constant δd ≈ 5.3 blocks, or an effective
start/end ≈ 101/134.5 — all the same linear warp. Live GL state still
reports 96/128, so this is evaluation / post-fog, not the configured
params.

**No magma code change.** Magma already matches the oracle formula
(`EntityRenderer.setupFog(0)` start=`far*0.75` end=`far`,
`glFogi(34138, 34139)` EYE_RADIAL) to 0.002 RMSE; fudging
`GM_TERRAIN_FOG_*` toward 101/134 would paper over the golden and break the
documented ramp. Next leads: (1) llvmpipe / capture GL fog evaluation vs
spec at large eye-radial d (does the driver honour LINEAR EYE_RADIAL as
`(d−start)/(end−start)`?), (2) any post-fog colour path on the recording
client that pulls toward terrain, (3) a live depth/fog-factor dump from the
Java capture at the same columns. Do not retune CLASS_PIXEL_BUDGETS for the
band.

Two sharpening facts (2026-07-27 review): the fitted endpoints are BOTH the
configured ones scaled by the same factor - 101/96 = 1.052 and
134.5/128 = 1.051 - so the warp is exactly "the capture stack's fog
distance reads as d/1.05", a multiplicative radial-distance underestimate,
not an additive offset or a start/end reconfiguration. And the recording
renderer is on record as llvmpipe (Mesa 26.0.3, the `glxinfo` preamble in
every `start_vnc_client.sh` log), so lead (1) concretely means: how does
Mesa/llvmpipe evaluate GL_NV_fog_distance EYE_RADIAL - per-vertex fog
coord with screen-linear interpolation across the quad would systematically
underestimate the radial distance of interior pixels on large ground quads
(chord-vs-arc), which has the right sign and is orientation-independent at
these view angles. Reproducing THAT (vertex-evaluated radial fog,
interpolated) in magma would be a mechanism port, not a fudge - but measure
it against a llvmpipe minimal repro first.

### The oracle's fogColor1 had not converged when recording started

Every scenario tape is worse at t=0 than at t=10, by 2-6x, on the whole-frame
mean. It is the same shape on all of them and it had never been filed because
each tape's t=0 sat under its own gate class. It is the whole reason
`suffocate_camera` and half the reason `elytra_dip` fail their gate: both have
t=0 failures with **zero** unexplained pixels, i.e. the frame is uniformly off
rather than structurally wrong.

The direction settles it: **magma is flat from t=0 and the ORACLE ramps.**
On `suffocate_camera`, golden sky goes 135.1 -> 140.9 and golden grass
117.9 -> 124.9 over the first 40 ticks while magma sits at 141.1 / 125.0 the
whole time. The error decays by 0.35 per 10 ticks, and 0.9^10 = 0.3487 - that
is exactly `EntityRenderer.updateRenderer`'s
`this.fogColor1 += (f2 - this.fogColor1) * 0.1F` (`EntityRenderer.java:327`),
which starts at 0 on a fresh EntityRenderer and had not finished converging by
recstart. magma implements the smoother correctly but seeds it converged
(`gm_uw_fog_c1_seed`, and `underwater.h` states the assumption out loud: "the
oracle client has been running long before recstart, so its c1 has converged").

Mechanism check, on `suffocate_camera` (whole mean/ch, tape floor 0.75):

| c1 seed | t=0 | t=10 | t=20 | t=30 | t=40 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| steady (current) | 7.69 | 2.41 | 1.16 | 0.85 | 0.75 |
| 0.88 | 3.70 | 1.19 | 0.89 | 0.77 | 0.76 |
| **0.90** | **2.44** | **0.82** | **0.80** | **0.73** | **0.72** |
| 0.93 | 3.17 | 0.98 | 0.77 | 0.74 | 0.72 |

One parameter, a single clean optimum, and fitting it on t=0 alone drags t=10,
t=20 and t=30 to the tape's floor as a side effect - it is the mechanism, not a
per-frame fit. With the seed supplied, the tape's gate goes **FAIL -> PASS**.

**Do not hardcode 0.90.** The starting value is a property of the recording
session and is not derivable from the tape: `cobweb_fall` and `water_dive` have
near-identical `total_time` (112 and 113) yet start at 0.9946 and 0.9612,
because what matters is the light the client saw while the world loaded. The
per-tape t=0 ratios measured on the sky band are suffocate 0.9632, water_dive
0.9612, lava_walk 0.9846, elytra_dip 0.9903, soulsand_ice 0.9941, cobweb_fall
0.9946, fence_collide 0.9996, flow_convert 1.0068 (the last two have no ramp).

Fixed the only honest way: the recorder now writes `fog_color1` into the tape
header (`QuantizedRL.recFogColor1`, reflected off `EntityRenderer`, -1 when
unreadable), and `replay_tape.py` seeds magma from it when present via
`MAGMA_FOG_C1_INIT`. Tapes recorded before the field existed return None and
keep the steady-state seed, so nothing re-baselines. **This is inert until the
tapes are re-recorded** - the same re-record that would close the inventory
keyframe and rain gaps.

`MAGMA_FOG_C1_INIT` also works standalone, for sweeping the value on tapes that
predate the header field.

### The lightmap ignores rain and thunder

`build_lightmap_lut` (`frame_capture.c`) calls
`cr_lightmap_rgb(0, sl, bl, sun, 0.0f, 0.0f)` - rain and thunder hardcoded to
zero - and its `sun` comes from `fc_sun_brightness(sin_table, world_time)`,
which takes no weather at all. Vanilla's `updateLightmap` uses
`world.getSunBrightness(1.0F)` (`EntityRenderer.java:892`), and
`getSunBrightnessFactor` (`World.java:1551`) scales it by
`(1 - rainStrength * 5/16)` and again by `(1 - thunderStrength * 5/16)`. So
magma lights every rainy frame as if the sky were clear.

Cleanest measurement is the first-person arm on the canonical tape, because it
reads the lightmap directly with no fog blend on top: through t=1800..1980 the
arm is a flat achromatic **0.670** golden/magma while sky (0.787/0.805/0.827)
and terrain (0.758/0.774/0.694) are chromatic and milder - they pick up part of
the darkening through the fog colour, which magma does model. Outside that
window the same arm measures 0.997.

Blocked on the recorder, not on the renderer: **no tape has ever recorded rain**
- there is no rain field in any header or row, so magma cannot know it is
raining. The recorder now writes `rain_strength` and `thunder_strength` into the
header (both public on `World`); wiring them through `build_lightmap_lut` is
pointless until a tape carries them, and the values are per-tick anyway, so a
window that starts mid-tape needs them on rows rather than the header. This is
what the canonical tape's `known:12` rain class has been standing in for.

### Windowed play lights entities fullbright

`game/frame_capture.c` fills every `GmEntityView`'s `lm_*` fields after the
view fills (`lm_lit=1` with the frame LUT texel, or `lm_lit=2` folded outside
the overworld). `app/game_main.c` has no such loop, so in the windowed path
mobs keep the `(GmEntityView){0}` that `gm_mobs_fill_views` writes, i.e.
`lm_lit=0` = fullbright: a mob at night or in a cave is drawn as bright as one
at noon. Terrain is correct (both paths bind `gm_lightmap_lut`); this is the
entity half of the same plumbing.

`gm_live_fill_views` (dropped items) is a second, smaller problem: unlike
`gm_mobs_fill_views` it does not zero the view before writing its fields, and
both callers declare `GmEntityView ents[]` as an uninitialized stack array. In
the capture path the `lm_*` loop overwrites the garbage; `skin` and
`death_ticks` are never written for items on either path. Zeroing it is not a
free fix: it can move capture-path pixels, so it wants a pixel gate rather than
a blind edit.

Measured by code reading only. No oracle capture covers windowed output, so
neither half has a pixel number attached.

### Remaining isolated render features

- One-frame loading sky after a dimension transfer.
- Enchantment glint.
- Chest model rendering and world-layout seed parity.
- Arrow ghost pitch on legacy tapes.
- General held-item registration and edge shading outside the pinned use poses.
- Sheep grazing/head pose is only partially matched.
- Dig particles are reconstructed but not pixel-perfect.

## Simulation and replay

- Entity-driven world edits such as crystal-explosion fire do not replay.
- Dragon ring-buffer cold start and unload reset differ.
- Some end-to-end Oracle runs lose the dragon boss-bar registration.
- Mob roster, AI/spawn details, and boat `UNDER_WATER` state remain incomplete.
- Aim-pin target changes can add a one-tick block-break lag.
- Hotbar arrow count can drift while the Oracle shoots.
- HUD heart-flash blinking is not modeled.

## Oracle, recorder, and world-state blockers

These are not established C product bugs, but they block direct parity claims:

- Tick 9811 Oracle save-state contains flowing water absent from pristine
  worldgen.
- Live-session population order can change individual decorations.
- Legacy GUI interactions and inventory contents were not fully recorded.
- Legacy tape headers omit `EntityRenderer.fogColor1` and its pre-capture
  brightness history. On `scenario_suffocate_camera_20260723T001923Z`, the
  actual in-block overlay frames pass, but t=0 is a frame-wide shading offset
  that decays from 7.69 mean/ch at t=0 to 2.41 at t=10 and 1.16 at t=20.
  Vanilla carries this 0.1/tick smoother in
  `EntityRenderer.updateRenderer`; reconstructing its initial value from the
  golden would be fitting an unrecorded constant.
- Walking/turning tapes retain partial-tick camera registration uncertainty.
- Legacy `EntityItem` rows omit required render state.
- The mine segment contains a mid-tape staged arena-state window.

When one of these is encountered, improve the recorder/pin or classify the
capture as blocked. Do not fit C output to an unproven Oracle state.
